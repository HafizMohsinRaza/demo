      Technical Specifications of Our Ammonia Cracker Purifier
    </div>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p class="inner-description">
      Gaztron's Ammonia cracking Purifier Unit is a highly efficient system
      designed to purify ammonia. It comprises two vessels filled with Molecular
      Sieves, with one vessel undergoing purification while the other is in the
      regeneration phase. The cycle time of the unit is adjustable to suit
      specific requirements.
    </p>
    <p class="inner-description">
      The Molecular Sieves employed in the system effectively eliminate
      un-cracked ammonia and moisture, ensuring thorough purification. To
      facilitate the process, a 3-Way inlet valve and 3-Way outlet valve, along
      with two 2-Way valves for exhaust lines, are incorporated between the two
      drying towers. These valves automatically open and close as per a
      controlled timer, enhancing operational convenience.
    </p>
    <p class="inner-description">
      For Molecular Sieve regeneration, a uniform temperature of 200 degrees
      Celsius is required. This heating process restores the Sieves'
      effectiveness. Gaztron's Ammonia cracking Purifier Unit is not only highly
      efficient but also characterized by low power consumption and
      user-friendly operation, making it an ideal choice for ammonia
      purification needs.

      The operational principle of the Ammonia Cracker Purifier Unit
    </div>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p class="inner-description">
      The Ammonia Cracker Purifier Unit is employed downstream of the Ammonia
      Cracker Unit to eliminate un-cracked Ammonia and moisture. It consists of
      two vessels filled with Molecular Sieves. One vessel operates in the
      purification cycle while the other undergoes regeneration. The cycle time
      can be adjusted as per requirements. The Molecular Sieves effectively
      remove un-cracked Ammonia and moisture. To control the process, a 3-Way
      inlet valve and a 3-Way outlet valve, along with two 2-Way valves for
      exhaust lines, are installed between the two drying towers. These valves
      automatically open and close according to a preset timer.
    </p>
    <p class="inner-description">
      During the regeneration process of the Molecular Sieves, they are heated
      to a temperature of 200 degrees Celsius. The high temperature causes the
      moisture and Ammonia absorbed in the Molecular Sieves to be released along
      with dry cracked gas. After regeneration, the bed is allowed to cool
      naturally to reach ambient temperature. Temperature Indicators are
      provided in the Molecular Sieve Towers to monitor these conditions. The
      dry and purified cracked gas then passes through a Rota meter before
      entering the system.
