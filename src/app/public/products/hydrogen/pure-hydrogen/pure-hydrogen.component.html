    <p class="description">
      Our high-pressure bipolar water electrolysis technology offers a simple
      and rapid means of producing hydrogen, utilizing only power and deionized
      water. Our product line includes systems capable of producing hydrogen at
      rates ranging from 0.25 Nm3/hr up to 500 Nm3/hr for a single electrolyzer.
      For higher production capacities, multiple electrolyzers can be connected
      to common subsystems.

    <p class="description">
      Our Electrolyzer features a Bipolar design, in which high purity DM water
      is split into H2 and O2 using DC power from a rectifier. Hydrogen is
      generated at the cathode side of the cells, while oxygen is produced at
      the anode side. This unique design results in a compact Electrolyzer unit
      that can produce gases at high pressure (15 Bar) directly, eliminating the
      need for a separate Hydrogen compressor for medium pressure Hydrogen
      requirements.

    <p class="description">
      The electrolyzer utilizes proton exchange membrane (PEM) technology,
      generating Hydrogen gas at the cathode at customer-preferred pressures,
      while oxygen gas is produced at the anode at pressures near ambient. The
      membrane's high bubble point ensures that oxygen does not mix with the
      hydrogen stream, ensuring safe and simple operation with a full
      differential pressure design.

      Gaztron’s Steam Reformer – Natural Gas / LPG / Naphtha
    </div>
    <p class="description">
      Our advanced production process for high purity hydrogen involves the
      steam reforming of hydrocarbons, followed by a PSA purification step. The
      feedstock is preheated by mixing it with a split stream of hydrogen and
      passing it through a sulfur removal process. It is then combined with
      superheated steam and passed through catalyst-filled reformer tubes, where
      it is converted into a syngas containing H2, CO, CO2, H2O, and CH4.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
      The hot syngas is then cooled through a heat exchanger, which recovers a
      significant amount of its sensible heat, before being passed through the
      CO-shift stage. The syngas is further cooled to ambient temperatures,
      resulting in the condensation and subsequent separation of water vapor.
      Finally, the purified hydrogen is isolated to the desired level of purity
      using a molecular sieve PSA purification unit.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      The reformer is fired by a high-velocity burner that consumes both fuel
      and tail gas. Any tail gas produced during the PSA purification stage is
      buffered in the tail gas buffer tank. The hot flue gases generated by the
      reformer are directed towards a waste heat boiler, which is used to
      superheat the feed/steam mixture and preheat the feed in the heat
      exchangers.
    </p>
    <br />
    <div class="heading">Gaztron’s Steam Reformer – Methanol Reforming</div>
    <p class="description">
      The production of high purity hydrogen involves a two-stage process of
      methanol reforming and PSA purification. Initially, a mixture of methanol
      and deionized water is vaporized in heat exchangers and directed to a
      heated catalyst reactor, which transforms the methanol/water vapor into a
      syngas containing hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, and
      water vapor. This syngas is subsequently cooled in a heat exchanger, with
      the water vapor condensed and recycled to the storage tank. The cooled
      syngas is then fed to the PSA purification unit, which utilizes a
      molecular sieve to isolate the hydrogen to the desired purity. The tail
      gas from the PSA purification unit is sent to the buffer tank and used as
      fuel for the required process heat.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
      The process heat can be supplied either by utilizing our Principal's
      distinctive circulation of hot inert gas or by using a thermal oil system.
      By using the circulation of inert gas instead of thermal oil as the heat
      transfer fluid for heating, the reformer renders a thermal oil system
      obsolete and avoids all associated expenses and issues related to handling
      thermal oil.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      In scenarios where thermal oil is already accessible or for large
      MeOH-based reforming plants (exceeding approximately 2000 Nm³/h H2), a
      thermal oil heated plant may be more feasible. This is because the
      physical equipment size of the circulated inert gas-based plant increases
      disproportionally.
