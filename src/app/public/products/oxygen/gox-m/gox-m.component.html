      The operational principle of Gaztron’s Oxygen Generator (GOX-M Model)
    </div>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p class="inner-description">
      Discover the power of Gaztron's Oxygen Generator (GOX-M Model), India's
      undisputed leader in manufacturing top-of-the-line Medical Oxygen
      Generators for the healthcare sector.
    </p>
    <p class="inner-description">
      Our revolutionary GOX-M Model operates on a cutting-edge principle that
      sets it apart from the competition. By intelligently utilizing an
      adsorbent bed of zeolite, carefully engineered to attract nitrogen more
      intensely than oxygen, our Oxygen Generator excels at producing highly
      enriched oxygen from a gas mixture like air.
    </p>
    <p class="inner-description">
      Under high pressure, the gas mixture flows through the zeolite-filled
      vessel, where nitrogen is effectively retained in the bed, leaving behind
      a remarkably oxygen-rich gas. The result? A continuous and reliable supply
      of high-purity oxygen, tailored to meet the stringent demands of the
      healthcare industry.
    </p>
    <p class="inner-description">
      Our GOX-M Model stands head and shoulders above the rest, not only in its
      superior performance but also in its efficient nitrogen adsorption and
      regeneration process. When the zeolite bed reaches its nitrogen adsorption
      capacity, a simple pressure reduction triggers the release of adsorbed
      nitrogen, seamlessly preparing the system for the next cycle of producing
      oxygen-enriched air.
    </p>
